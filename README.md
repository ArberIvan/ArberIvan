## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 28 years old and currently work as an IT Specialist. I have experience and courses in data analysis and data science through my own entrepreneurial projects. I consider myself analytical and highly creative, with curiosity being my strongest trait. Iâ€™m not afraid of the unknown; rather, it motivates me to continuously explore new technologies and procedures.

Iâ€™m looking for a place where I can face new challenges to apply my skills and acquire new ones.

Outside of my professional career, I am a player and physical trainer for an ultimate frisbee team in the city of ParanÃ¡, Entre RÃ­os. On my days off, I work out in the gym or practice calisthenics. Iâ€™m passionate about sports and engage in physical activities almost every day of the week.
