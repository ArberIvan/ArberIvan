## Hi, my name is IvÃ¡n Arber ðŸ‘‹

I am 28 years old and currently work as an IT Specialist. I have experience and training in data analysis and data science through my own entrepreneurial projects. I consider myself an analytical and highly creative person, driven by curiosity to continuously explore new technologies and procedures. I am not afraid of the unknown; instead, it motivates me to keep learning and improving.

I am looking for a place where I can face new challenges that allow me to apply my skills and continue growing professionally.

Outside of work, I am a player and physical trainer for an ultimate frisbee team in ParanÃ¡, Entre RÃ­os. In my free time, I go to the gym and practice calisthenics, enjoying sports almost every day of the week.

In this space, I will upload the most relevant projects I have worked on so far. They cover a variety of topics, with some done as part of my job and others outside of it.
